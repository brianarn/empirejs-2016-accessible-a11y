## Why Do We Care?

---

### Improved UX

Better accessibility helps everyone

---

### It's THE LAW

- Americans with Disabilities Act
- Section 508

???

Target lawsuit timeline:

- 1990: ADA was enacted, prohibiting discrimination by places of public
  accomodation
- 2005: National Federation of the Blind and Target tried to work it out
- 2006: NFB sued Target for their inaccessible website, citing it as a place of
  public accomodation
- 2008: Settlement reached, $6mil settlement fund was established

Section 508 matters if you ever care to sell services to the US Gov't
